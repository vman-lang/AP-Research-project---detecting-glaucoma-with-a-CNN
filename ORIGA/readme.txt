This data set is released for academic research use only.

The data set has 650 images. The images are given in JPG format and the manual disc/cup markings are given in the Matlab MAT file. By loading the MAT file, e.g., load('001.mat');
you will obtain a variable 'mask'. The optic disc and cup region by the expert can be determined as
disc=double(mask>0);
cup=double(mask>1);


In the attached excel file, we have also given the diagnosis and the pre-computed vertical CDRs based on the manual markings.

Please refer to our papers below for more details of the data set.
